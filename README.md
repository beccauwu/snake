<!-- Introduction -->
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://beccauwu.github.io/snake)

This site is a web game for the classic Snake-game popular from Nokia phones. The site is divided into 2 pages - the index page and the actual game page.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- Styling -->
<h2 id="styling">2. Site Styling</h2>

Here I will go through all the different design choices and talk about what implications they are designed to have on user experience. As a general note here in the beginning, it would be important to stress that usability has been the top priority in creating the site and thorough testing has been done to see potential flaws and fix them.


<h3 id="colours-and-fonts"> 2.1. Colours and Fonts</h3>

**Colours**

![Site colour scheme][colours]

As the site is based on an old game, I chose to go with colours that also reflect this. The main colours of the game are red, green and yellow. The index page also has purple text for its h2 elements.

The colour of the snake is red, and the canvas background colour is grey to make the canvas stand out from the body's very dark almost black colour. The food is green to make it stand out in relation to the snake. All elements with text on the page have the same grey background as the canvas to be consistent, with varying colours of text to add diversity and an 'old game feel' to it.

The border colours of text elements are always different from the text colour on the game page - if the text is yellow or red, the border is green, if the text inside an element is both yellow and green, the border is red.

**Fonts**

The main font used is a monospace called Source Code Pro. It being a monospace follows the old theme of the site. A Sans Serif font, Ubuntu is used on the index page where there is more text content to make it easier read.

<h3 id="pages">2.2. Pages</h3>

<h4 id="footer"> 2.2.1 Footer</h4>

![Footer Image][footer] 

The footer is a simple copyright notice.

<h4 id="index"> 2.2.2. Index</h4>

![Capture of the index pages][index]

Upon landing onto the index page, the user is presented with the introduction to the game. Here the user can click through the text either using the arrows or the numbered buttons. The two pages, apart from the first page, are each there to explain the basics of the game - rules and controls. 

There are only two rules, I primarily wanted to specify that in contrast to many other snake games, the game does not end when the snake hits the wall. The second rule is sort of obvious if you've seen the game before, so I just wanted to make a joke out of it.

On the page explaining the controls for the game I also added a mention of the leaderboard for the game, and challenged the user to try to beat the persons on there.

The user has the opportunity to skip the introduction and continue straight to the game if desired.

<h4 id="snake">2.2.3. Snake</h4>

**Gameplay**

The objective of the game is to get as high of a score as possible by eating "fruits", the green blocks appearing on the canvas. Every time the snake eats a fruit it grows one block, the score increases by 10, and the speed of the snake increases. The game ends when the snake collides with itself, which becomes increasingly difficult to avoid the longer you play. 

![Leaderboard at game end][dead]

When the game ends, the leaderboard is shown and the user has the possibility of adding themselves to it.

**Layout**

![Capture of leaderboard][leaderboard]

When the game page is first opened, the user is presented with the current “leaderboard” for the game, and a 5-second countdown starts after which the game begins. The game canvas itself is fully responsive in size.

![Capture of vertical mode][portrait]

If played in vertical mode without a keyboard (i.e., usually on mobile), there user can use the button controls underneath the canvas.

![Controls in horizontal mode][controls-landscape]
![Capture of horizontal mode][landscape]

In horizontal mode the controls and score are on the side of the canvas and the user has the option to switch sides as preferred. 
Underneath the controls in vertical mode or underneath the canvas in horizontal mode, there is a button to open the leaderboard that was first presented when opening the page. When the user has started playing, they have the option to add themselves to the table and if their score is high enough, they will be displayed on the page. In this view the score is positioned underneath the table and the button for closing the leaderboard is appended to the same container as the other elements.

**Controls**

The controls on a PC are the keys WASD – W to move up, A to move left, S to move down, and D to move right. The key P is used to pause the game. 

![Controls capture][controls]

Another option for controlling the game is through a D-pad, where the arrow keys change the movement direction, and the middle control button toggles pausing.  
When the game is resumed from pause, there is a 3-second countdown for it to start again, to give time for the user to get prepared, which can be especially important at higher scores due to the increasing speed every time the snake eats.

<h2 id="testing">3. Testing</h2>

<h3 id="methods">3.1. Methodology and Results</h3>

All of the pages have been thoroughly tested by individuals as well as using software such as ARC and Lighthouse. The user feedback has been positive, without any major suggestions for improvement. Both softwares showed some issues, which have been solved as well as they possibly could have been using the already existing site framework. The CSS and HTML have been passed through the W3C validation service, and the JavaScript has been passed through JSHint without errors.

![Lighthouse results][lighthouse]

<h3 id="issues">3.2. Issues During Testing</h3>

Both ARC and Lighthouse flagged the contrast ratio of the red text on the dark background in various places. This has been combatted by increasing the font size and weight where needed. It is still being flagged but is fully readable through various colour blindness filters. Multiple-user testing has also not yielded any negative reviews on this.

<h2 id="bugs">4. Bugs</h2>

**Fixed**

Bug: Snake marked as dead when game was paused

Fix: Declare a variable, which is false when game is paused, and the function for game end won’t check for death.

Bug: Responsive canvas size ended up creating odd-numbered sizes

Fix: Round the output of adaptive style into the nearest 10-number

**Persistent**

Bug: When pressing two buttons too quickly after each other, it may cause the snake to turn on itself and thus ending the game. This bug really only affects PC players, it isn’t possible to click the D-pad buttons fast enough to make this happen.


<h2 id="deployment">5. Deployment</h2>

I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure:

1. From the project's repository, go to the Settings tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the Pages tab.
3. Under the Source section, select the Main branch from the drop-down menu and click Save.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.

You can find the live site via the following URL - [Snake live webpage](https://beccauwu.github.io/snake)

<h2 id="future-enhancements">6. Future Enhancements</h2>

There are a few details I would like to improve with the site in the future:

1. **Add a database for the leaderboard**

I was in the beginning working with Google Firebase’s Realtime Database to add a working leaderboard. I got nearly there but realised I should spend the time instead making the game work so I instead made an array with preset players with different scores as a ‘proof of concept’. The Firebase capabilities are nearly ready to deploy as I did make a local copy of the files when I switched and plan on adding this as soon as possible.

2. **Add settings**

In the future I am planning to implement different user configurable settings for the colour scheme as well as game difficulty levels.
